So during the last Sprint, we continue our research about major version 12 features.

We are taking some cases in advance for the service pack and also fixing some cases for the next year service pack for the 12 version.

We decided to perform the research to summarise all these feature requests.

Regarding vulnerabilities, no new vulnerabilities are found.

So actually JP and CN… tasks like AI integration.

We discussed the new feature … using web assembly code for report layout.

The second feature is the new Excel export, which is … waiting for years to be revised.

I think that we can deliver all these tasks within the version 12 release.

And as you can see that the next service pack is almost done. We will release it in the middle of June.

I think you could start implementing this core part that communicates with AI engine.

I expect I want to finish all the features maybe in October and the rest time will be for stabilization.
